# proteomicApp

The app is based on a pioneering study led by CONICET scientists, which was published in a high-impact journal in the field. The study underscores the remarkable potential of solanocapsin, an extract from an Argentine plant, as a promising therapy for challenging tumors resistant to PARP inhibitors. Solanocapsin selectively targets BRCA2-deficient cells while sparing healthy ones, minimizing DNA damage. This breakthrough led to the development of NorAdS, an optimized derivative.

The app serves as a dynamic platform facilitating the understanding and exploration of research data specifically within the field of proteomics. It offers interactive, customizable tools for filtering, visualizing, and comparing data, including valuable metadata. It was specifically designed for the "ContarConDatos 2023 edition" contest.
